# Enhancing Banorte's Hybrid Banking Experience

## Introduction

### Project Background
This project was realized for Banorte, a leading Mexican bank, in it's 2023 24-hour Hackathon. Among 50 participants, we won first place and received a 40K MXN check. The project addresses the challenges faced by Banorte in the aftermath of the 2020-2022 pandemic. As digital banking surged due to health constraints, a significant shift back to physical banking was observed once restrictions eased. Our aim is to improve the hybrid human/digital banking infrastructure, particularly targeting young adults (18-29 years) and seniors (>60 years), who are currently underserved by the banking sector.

### Problem Statement
The project's goal is to optimize customer service channels by digitizing certain processes, relieving the strain on physical branches while enhancing the in-branch customer experience. Additionally, the project aims to increase inclusivity by catering to younger adults and seniors.

### FYI
This repository originally only included the back-end. The front-end was in a private repository. I added it here in order to submit the whole application for the MLH Fellowship. Below are my personal contributions to the project:
- Front-end
    - Expense Management
    - Face-recognition 
- Back-end
    - Function
    - DialogFlow integration
    - Intends implementation

## Proposed Solution
Our solution is presented as a collection of three pillars that include both internal improvement factors (enhancements for the physical branches and mobile banking) as well as external strategies (for attracting and retaining customers). These pillars are digital banking, traditional banking, and hybrid banking.

### Digital Banking
The digital banking solution proposes changes to digital channels (mobile banking and products intended for use outside physical locations). This includes a UI redesign, introduction of a virtual assistant, and emotion recognition for improved user experience.

### UI Redesign
A significant overhaul of the app’s UI has been proposed, which aims at modernizing the application’s appearance and making it more user-friendly without compromising current functionality. The design employs the 60-30-10 color palette technique, providing a pleasing perspective to the user.

### Virtual Assistant - Sr. Banorte
The integration of an AI virtual assistant, Sr. Banorte, within the mobile banking application aims to enhance user experience. Sr. Banorte is designed to provide financial coaching, learn and automate expenses, detect frauds, conduct transactions, and offer personalized communication based on user-specific characteristics. It was built using Google Cloud services and DialogFlow.

### Emotion Recognition for Enhanced User Experiences
Banorte emphasized taking the user’s emotional state into account in our solution. Thus, we proposed a feature to recognize the user’s current emotional well-being when logging in with facial recognition. Due to time, we did not add a login system to the app, as it was a low priority and of low value. However, we added a stand-alone face recognition feature to showcase the proposal in _/face-recognition_.

### Hybrid Banking
Our hybrid banking strategy, Banorte Generations, focuses on creating a direct link between traditional and digital banking. It aims to capture new customers across different demographics through the creation of three targeted campaigns - Banorte Youth, Banorte Lifetime, and Banorte University. We included different screens for these programs in the app. 

- **Banorte Youth**: The Banorte Youth campaign proposes a credit card, Banorte Young, for young adults. It's designed to retain customers beyond their use of the payroll card, incentivizing continued use of Banorte’s mobile banking services.

- **Banorte Lifetime**: The Banorte Lifetime campaign targets older adults, offering extra security measures against phishing and providing exclusive intergenerational benefits.

- **Banorte University**: Banorte University is an educational initiative offering users financial literacy resources.

### Banorte Expense Management
This feature allows you to create a group and effortlessly divide costs among members. Just input your expenses, specify the participants, and let the feature handle the calculations. It eliminates the need for manual calculations and spreadsheets, making the process of splitting bills hassle-free.
